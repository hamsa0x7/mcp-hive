##  The Story: Breaking the Hallucination Loop

If you’ve spent enough time working with LLM-based coding agents, you’ve eventually hit "The Wall." You ask for a complex multi-file audit or a major refactor, and your primary agent—constrained by its single-threaded nature—reaches its limit. It can't "think" in parallel.

This is where the **Hallucination Loop** begins. To satisfy your workflow, the agent starts "simulating" research. It tells you it "verified the security logs" or "checked the dependencies," when in reality, it just sat in the same context window, making its best guess because it had no other way to satisfy the requirement.

**MCP Hive** was built to solve this environmental dead end by establishing a high-force production environment.

##  The Hierarchy of the Hive

Effective swarming requires a clear chain of command. In our production environment:

1.  👑 **The Queen (Antigravity)**: The primary agent. She owns the conversation, the strategy, and the ultimate decision-making. She is the single source of truth for the project.
2.  🎬 **The Drone (MCP Hive)**: The technical orchestrator. The Drone listens to the Queen and manages the logistics of the swarm—handling API keys, model routing, and parallelization.
3.  🐝 **The Worker Bees (Subagents)**: The specialists. These are parallel, headless agents spawned by the Drone to perform surgical tasks (Security Audit, Logic Review, Context Mapping).
4.  🏟️ **The Hive**: Your production environment. It is the space where this entire system lives and breathes.

##  The Solution: High-Force Delegation

The Queen handles the strategy, while the **Drone** handles the brute-force technical execution:

- **`hive_swarm`**: The Queen launches a swarm. The Drone handles the decomposition—assigning different specialists (Worker Bees) to different file chunks simultaneously.
- **`hive_harvest`**: The Drone gathers the merged findings and returns them to the Queen. No more bloated context windows; just surgical results.
- **`hive_post_insight`**: Allows Worker Bees to share discoveries in real-time on a shared board, visible to the entire swarm.
- **`hive_spawn_subtask`**: Allows Worker Bees to request a *new* specialist Bee mid-flight if they discover an unexpected sub-problem.

##  Quick Start

1.  **Clone & Install**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hamsa0x7/mcp-hive.git
    cd mcp-hive
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Register**:
    ```bash
    npm run register
    ```
    This auto-writes your paths to your global `mcp_config.json`.

3.  **Add Keys**:
    Replace API key placeholders in your `mcp_config.json` with real credentials.

4.  **Verify**:
    Restart your MCP client and ask: *"`Analyze src/server.ts using hive_swarm`"*

##  Governance

- **Concurrency Control**: 50 active outbound requests (process-wide) with a 5-request cap per provider per swarm.
- **Scale**: Up to 15 parallel specialists per batch.
- **Security**: Strict path sandboxing with Symlink Escape protection.
